This script monitors the csv file generated by the sensor logging of OpenHardwareMonitor https://openhardwaremonitor.org/

It is a fast and dirty implementation, so you will not find any unity along with the indicators, and the name of the metric is based on the simple aggregation of the first two rows of the sensor csv file.

You will need to have python3 and pyzabbix installed, and schedule a task to periodically run the script. There´s a getOHM.bat to make thinks easier for scheduling. You can disable the appearence of the execution by enabling the option "Run whether user is logged on or not" in windows task scheduler.

Low level discovery and data collection are done by the same script.

I recommend you set the sensor log interval lower than the task interval, to avoid duplicated reading. For example, sensor log interval 30 seconds and task interval 1 minute.

You will want to configure Open Hardware Monitor to:
- Run on Windows startup
- Start minimized
- Minimize to tray
- Minimize on close
- Log sensors

Tested with:
- Open Hardware Monitor v0.9.6 - https://openhardwaremonitor.org/
- Zabbix 5.0.8 
- python 3.8.10
- pyzabbix 0.8.2
